# href social - All your social links at one place

## Overview

**href social** is a web application built with ReactJS, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, Redux, Redux Toolkit, and react-hook-form that allows users to create personalized link pages with their various social media profiles and websites. The project utilizes `react-hash` to generate unique hashcodes for each user's page. This hashcode serves as a security key to enable users to edit their profiles securely.
